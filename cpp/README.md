# Description
This is a implementation of the TOPP-RA algorithm.

# Building Tests

```sh
# clone
git clone -b develop https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra

# build
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/openrobots/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/openrobots
mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DBUILD_WITH_PINOCCHIO=ON -DBUILD_WITH_qpOASES=ON ..
make -j4

# run test
./tests/all_tests
```

## Running test with pinocchio

Install pinocchio bindings and exmaple from robotpkg, then setup
environment variables:

``` sh
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/opt/openrobots/share
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/openrobots/lib/python3.6/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
# or any python version that you install
```

## How to install optional dependencies:

- GLPK: `sudo apt install libglpk-dev`
- qpOASES: `sudo apt install robotpkg-qpoases` (follow http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/debian.html for robotpkg)
- pinocchio: `sudo apt install robotpkg-pinocchio` (follow http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/debian.html for robotpkg)
- OpenRAVE: (follow https://github.com/crigroup/openrave-installation)

## Building with Python bindings

- Install pybind11 2.5.0
- Build toppra-cpp with bindings on
``` sh
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1 -DBUILD_WITH_PINOCCHIO=ON -DBUILD_WITH_qpOASES=ON -DBUILD_WITH_GLPK=ON -DBUILD_WITH_OpenRAVE=ON -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -DPYBIND11_PYTHON_VERSION=3.7 ..
# change to 3.8 or other version as needed.
# build and test
ninja 
```
- Install toppra python normally.

## Issues during build

``` sh
/usr/local/include/pybind11/detail/common.h:112:10: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
 #include <Python.h>
          ^~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
```
This is because during compilation, `pybind11` can not find the Python header files. 
Check that you have `libpython-dev` or `libpython3-dev` installed and whether the 
correct Python executable  is found during cmake step. You should see something similar to
below:

``` sh
-- Found PythonInterp: /usr/bin/python3.7 (found suitable version "3.7.4", minimum required is "3.7")
-- Found PythonLibs: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.7m.so
-- Found /usr/include/python3.7m /usr/bin/python3.7
```

## Building doxygen doc

Make sure that `doxygen` is installed and available. Running cmake
normally will create a rule for building doc with doxygen.

``` sh
# Run cmake normally
ninja doc # or make doc
# The documentation is available at doc/doc/html/index.html
```

# Using TOPPRA in CMake-based project

In your CMakeLists.txt,
```cmake
# The following line defines cmake target toppra::toppra
find_package(toppra)
...
target_link_library(foo PUBLIC toppra::toppra)
```
